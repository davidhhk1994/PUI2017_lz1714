I mainly followed Dr. Federica's instructions on Assignment 1 and 2.
Based on those instructions, I understood the goals of the assignments and how to achieve them in general.

Zhiao Zhou taught me how to fit a gaussian to the distribution of means.
Yukun Wan helped me understand where to store the data when my script reads data on compute.

With Zhiao Zhou, Cheng Ma, Chenrui Zhang, Ci He, Yukun Wan, we have also discussed the meaning of "Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means."
