For Assignment 1 & 2, I did individually.                                        
For Assignment 3, I asked Yukun Wan about the meaning of the question.         
For Assignment 4, Yukun Wan recommanded me to use geoJson file to read.

## Outline of what I did
### Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal.
I reviewed the work of Praveen Ashok Kumar (pak348, praveenashokkumar)

### Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests.

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
 ANCOVA	 | 2, HIV group, control group | categorical | 1, environment quality of life (QOL)| continuous | 1, the effect of location of residence | categorical | 	Does people living with HIV (PLWH) who received provision of antiretroviral treatment (ART) have higher quality of life (QOL) for environment domains?| There shows lower or the same scores for the HIV group after controlling for the effect of location of residence | 0.05 | [Higher Quality of Life and Lower Depression for People on ART in Uganda as Compared to a Community Control Group](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105154) |
 Multiple linear regression	 | 11, apoB, apoA-I, apoB/apoA-I, alcohol intake, log-transformed TG, log-transformed hsCRP, LDL-cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, regular exercise, and BMI | continuous, categorical | 1, Framingham risk score| continuous | N/A | N/A | 	Examine the association between the risk factors of CHD and the risk for CHD estimated by FRS | There is no correlation between the risk factors of CHD and the risk for CHD estimated by FRS | 0.05 | [Prediction of Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease Using Framingham Risk Score in Korean Men](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045030) |
 Logistic Regression	 | 14, age, HR, BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, FPG, PBG, IR, TG, DM and its duration, and PH and its duration | continuous, categorical | 1, CA dysfunction| categorical | N/A | N/A | 	 Estimate the potential risk factors of cardiovascular autonomic (CA) dysfunction | All factors are not significantly associated with CA dysfunction | 0.05 | [Comparison of Prediction Model for Cardiovascular Autonomic Dysfunction Using Artificial Neural Network and Logistic Regression Analysis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070571) |

### Assignment 3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY.
Did the Z-test and the Chi-squre test.

### Assignment 4: Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.
Used the shapely.geometry package to determine whether a point is in certain polygon.
