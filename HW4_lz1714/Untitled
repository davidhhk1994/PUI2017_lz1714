Figure 2: The cumulative distribution of citibike trip-durations.
The difference mainly occurs during 500 seconds to 2000 seconds.

Null hypothesis: The trip durations of bikers that ride during the day vs night have no difference.
The KS test returned two values:
1. statistic=0.043782288537372094, is the KS statistic.
2. pvalue=0.0, the possibility of null hypothesis happens.
As pvalue < alpha, we can reject the Null hypothesis.
The trip durations of bikers that ride during the day vs night are different.

NdfDay = dfDay.sample(frac=0.005, replace=True)
NdfNight = dfNight.sample(frac=0.005, replace=True)

ks = stats.ks_2samp(NdfDay.tripduration, NdfNight.tripduration)
print (ks)
