# Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
Test group: Eat two meals per day but no exercise.
Control group: Eat three meals per day and run 5 miles per day.

H0: The average percentage of weight lost by people in the test sample on a diet lose less or the same as for the control sample.
H0: Pt <= Pc

My answer:
H0: Test group's BMI decrease less or the same as the control group after 3 months.
H1: Test group's BMI decrease more than the control group after 3 months.


### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
Does smoking during pregnancy permanently affcets the IQ of the child?

H0: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke.



### Contribute to the incidence of diabetes 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0: There is no spatial correlation between the prevalence of diabetes and the distribution of food deserts.
H1: There is a higher incidence of diabetes in proximity of food deserts.
