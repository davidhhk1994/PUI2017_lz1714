Assignment 1: Work independently.                                        
Assignment 2: Work independently.                                         
Assignment 3: Yuwen Chang helped me understand the meaning of influence plot. Zhiao Zhou helped me understand how to calculate the weights of WLS.

## Outline of what I did
### Assignment 1: Test the Z test.
1. Generated 500 samples of size 100 from Poisson distribution.
2. Calculated all Z statistics and fit into the Gaussian distribution.

### Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit.
1. Performed test for goodness of fit (KS, AD, KL, Pearson's chisq).
2. Changing the parameters of the Binomial/Poisson distribution when fitting the Gaussian distribution.

### Assignment 3: Investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP.
1. Plotted figures related to fire arms in 22 countries.
2. OLS, WLS
3. seaborn.regplot
4. stsatsmodels.graphics.infulence_plot
